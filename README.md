# MC EJS
This is a small Node server that uses Express, EJS View, [Request JSON](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-json "Request JSON"), and [Minecraft Server Status](https://api.mcsrvstat.us/ "Minecraft Server Status") to give a real time look at your online Minecraft Server.

The pages have been designed from the ground up with [(MD)Bootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com "(MD)Bootstrap"). They have mobility and accessbility in mind.
